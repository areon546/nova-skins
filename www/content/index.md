# Welcome to the Nova Drift Custom Skin Repository

Here you can see all of the skins made available on the Nova Drift Discord in the Custom Skins channel.
Go to [Page_1](pages/Page_1.html) to see the start of this project.

To download all the skins in this project: <a href="https://github.com/areon546/nova-skins/raw/refs/heads/main/media/assets/custom_skins.zip" download="true">All the Skins</a>

You can then just replace the custom_skins folder already present in NovaDrift with the unzipped download, and hey presto you have all the skins in the repo.
