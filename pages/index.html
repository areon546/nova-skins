# Welcome to the Nova Drift Custom Skin Repository

Here you can see all of the skins made available on the Nova Drift Discord in the Custom Skins channel. 
Go to [Page_1](pages/Page_1.md) to see the start of this project. 

To download all the skins in this project, click [here](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/areon546/NovaDriftCustomSkinRepository/tree/main/custom_skins). 
The website shall download the custom skins. It may take a while since there's a lot of files, but the download should start shortly. 

You can then just replace the custom_skins folder already present in NovaDrift with the unzipped download, and hey presto you have all the skins in the repo.
