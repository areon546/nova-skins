<!--  [![Deploy to Github Pages](https://github.com/areon546/NovaDriftCustomSkinRepository/actions/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/areon546/NovaDriftCustomSkinRepository/actions/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml) -->

To download all skins, click [here](https://github.com/areon546/NovaDriftSkins/raw/main/media/custom_skins.zip). It may take a while however since there are a lot of files to download.

You can then just replace the custom_skins folder already present in NovaDrift with the unzipped download, and hey presto you have all the skins in the repo.

Go to [Page_1](pages/Page_1.md) to see the start of this project.

[custom_skins](custom_skins) contains all the skins this project uses, updated periodically
[pages](pages) contains all the skins for display that you can look through and download the contents of manually
