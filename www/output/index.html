  <h1>Welcome to the Nova Drift Custom Skin Repository</h1>

<p>Here you can see all of the skins made available on the Nova Drift Discord in the Custom Skins channel.
Go to <a href="pages/Page_1.html">Page_1</a> to see the start of this project.</p>

<p>To download all the skins in this project, click <a href="https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/areon546/NovaDriftCustomSkinRepository/tree/main/custom_skins">here</a>.
The website shall download the custom skins. It may take a while since there&rsquo;s a lot of files, but the download should start shortly.</p>

<p>You can then just replace the custom_skins folder already present in NovaDrift with the unzipped download, and hey presto you have all the skins in the repo.</p>
