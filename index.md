# Welcome to the Nova Drift Custom Skin Repository

Here you can see all of the skins made available on the Nova Drift Discord in the Custom Skins channel. 
Go to [Page_1](pages/Page_1.md) to see the start of this project. 

To download all the skins in this project: [DOWNLOAD](custom_skins.zip). 

You can then just replace the custom_skins folder already present in NovaDrift with the unzipped download, and hey presto you have all the skins in the repo and will be able to download all of them.
